These subfolders contain variations of the complete kinetic model for CVB3, which execute specific instances of the model and recreate specific modeling figures and subpanels.  They should be run as an open directory in MATLAB with a path that contains a directory to the complete kinetics base functions available here:  https://github.com/JanesLab/CompleteKinetics-CVB3
